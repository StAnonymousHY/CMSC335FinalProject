App Description: <br>
Allow users to register their own accounts using email and password and log in to search for movies they are interested in. This website also keeps a list of history searches for each user independently. <br>
There is an endpoint for this website that cannot be reached by any other methods aside from directly typing the endpoint into the address bar. This endpoint is /clearCollection, and its functionality is to clear all the user information stored in MongooseDB. Once you type this endpoint into the address bar and hit enter, the website will delete all users' information and redirect you back to the log-in page. It serves as a quick admin way to clear everything in this database, but please be aware that after using this endpoint, you will have to sign up again for your account.
